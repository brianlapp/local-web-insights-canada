# Active Development Context

# Current Task
Debugging and fixing business scraper functionality after successful Railway deployment.

# Mode
PLAN mode only unless ACT is typed.

# Analysis Service Focus
We've implemented a comprehensive data analysis service that processes the data collected by the scraper service to generate actionable insights and reports:

- Geographic analysis and business density calculations
- Category performance analytics and benchmarking
- Business comparison against competitors and industry averages
- Automated report generation with visualization configurations
- Scheduled analysis processing for daily, weekly, and monthly insights

# Implementation Strategy
We've established a structured approach with the following components:

1. **Data Aggregators**: Three specialized modules for geographic, category, and business comparison analysis
2. **Report Generation**: Pipeline for transforming analysis data into standardized reports with chart configurations
3. **Job Processing**: Queue-based system for asynchronous report generation with progress tracking
4. **API Endpoints**: RESTful interface for accessing reports and requesting new analysis
5. **Database Schema**: Specialized tables for storing analysis results and report configurations

## Key Implementation Files:
- `aggregators/geographicInsights.ts` - Location-based analysis
- `aggregators/categoryAnalysis.ts` - Industry category performance analysis
- `aggregators/businessComparison.ts` - Competitive benchmarking
- `reports/reportGenerator.ts` - Report building and formatting
- `processors/reportProcessor.ts` - Queue processing for report generation

# What to skip
- Overly complex analysis algorithms
- Manual data processing tasks
- UI-specific visualization implementations

Cursor should:
- Focus on the data analysis service implementation
- Ensure efficient and reliable data processing
- Maintain a clear separation of concerns between modules

## Current Focus
- Debugging and fixing API routes for the business scraper functionality
- Resolving errors in the scraper job queue system
- Ensuring proper Redis configuration and connectivity
- Maintaining TypeScript build compatibility while adding debug functionality

## Recent Changes
- Successfully deployed scraper service to Railway with ESM compatibility
- Fixed Redis connection and configuration in Railway
- Added diagnostic tools and test endpoints to debug scraper API issues
- Simplified error handling in API routes to avoid TypeScript errors
- Improved frontend error reporting and API connectivity testing
- Fixed issues with the business scraper tool API endpoint

## Current Architecture
- Microservices:
  - Scraper Service (Node.js/TypeScript)
    - Successfully deployed to Railway
    - Using ESM modules throughout
    - Fixed route handling and error reporting
    - Added diagnostic endpoints for testing
    - Bull queue integration with Redis
  - Analysis Service (Node.js/TypeScript)
    - Data aggregation modules
    - Report generation system
    - Scheduled insight processing
    - RESTful API endpoints
  - Redis service
    - Successfully configured in Railway
    - Connected to the scraper service
    - Used for Bull job queues
- Infrastructure:
  - Docker containers
  - Supabase for data storage
  - Express for API endpoints
  - Bull for job processing

## Next Steps
1. Implement error monitoring and logging for production:
   - Add more comprehensive error logging
   - Set up centralized log collection
   - Implement alerting for critical errors

2. Optimize the scraper service performance:
   - Improve job queue processing efficiency
   - Implement rate limiting for external API calls
   - Add retry mechanisms for transient failures

3. Enhance frontend integration:
   - Improve error handling and user feedback
   - Add progress indicators for long-running jobs
   - Implement detailed job status reporting

## Dependencies
- Node.js 18
- TypeScript 5.x with ESM support
- Railway platform
- Redis (pending)
- Express 4
- Bull 4
- Turf.js
- Supabase
- Docker

## Environment Configuration
Required environment variables:
- PORT
- NODE_ENV
- REDIS_URL (pending)
- SUPABASE_URL
- SUPABASE_API_KEY
- LOG_LEVEL

## Active Decisions
1. Railway Configuration Strategy
   - Use railway.toml as single source of truth
   - Avoid duplicate settings in Railway UI
   - Use explicit cd commands for directory management
   - Maintain ESM compatibility in TypeScript config

2. Module System
   - Use ESM throughout the scraper service
   - Add .js extensions to all imports
   - Configure package.json with "type": "module"
   - Update TypeScript configuration for ESM

3. Analysis Architecture
   - Modular aggregator design
   - Report generation pipeline
   - Job queue implementation
   - Scheduled processing strategy

4. API Design
   - RESTful endpoint structure
   - Filtering and pagination
   - Authentication approach
   - Response format standardization

5. Database Schema
   - Report storage strategy
   - Insight data modeling
   - Historical trend tracking
   - Performance optimization

6. Integration Approach
   - Service communication methods
   - Data synchronization
   - Event handling
   - Error recovery

## Current Challenges
1. Technical
   - ESM vs CommonJS module conflicts
   - TypeScript build errors
   - Railway deployment configuration
   - Monorepo service management

2. Infrastructure
   - Railway deployment process
   - Redis service setup
   - Environment variable management
   - Build process optimization

3. Data Quality
   - Analysis accuracy
   - Insight relevance
   - Report visualization effectiveness
   - Real-time vs. batch processing

## Recent Learnings
1. Railway Configuration:
   - railway.toml OVERRIDES any UI settings
   - Root directory setting can conflict between UI and TOML
   - Explicit cd commands more reliable than rootDirectory
   - Build detection happens before TOML application

2. TypeScript/ESM:
   - Need .js extensions in import statements
   - package.json requires "type": "module"
   - CommonJS/ESM conflicts with certain packages
   - Build process needs proper module configuration

3. API Error Handling:
   - TypeScript can be strict about error typing in Express routes
   - Simplifying debug code may be necessary to maintain build compatibility
   - Using console.log for critical debugging can help identify issues in Railway logs
   - Test endpoints are valuable for isolating API connectivity issues

4. Queue Processing:
   - Bull queue requires reliable Redis connection
   - Error handling in queue processors needs to be robust
   - Queue operations should be wrapped in try/catch blocks
   - Job data should be validated before processing

## Questions Resolved
1. Technical
   - Railway.toml takes precedence over UI settings
   - ESM requires explicit .js extensions
   - TypeScript needs specific ESM configuration
   - Monorepo requires explicit directory management

## Next Actions
1. Fix all TypeScript build errors
2. Complete Railway deployment
3. Set up Redis service
4. Test end-to-end functionality

## Recent Feedback
- Need for actionable business insights
- Importance of competitive benchmarking
- Request for geographic visualization
- Focus on automated report generation
