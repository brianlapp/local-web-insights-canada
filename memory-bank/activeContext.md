# Active Development Context

# Current Task
Implementing the Data Analysis & Insights Layer for the Local Web Insights Canada platform.

# Mode
PLAN mode only unless ACT is typed.

# Analysis Service Focus
We've implemented a comprehensive data analysis service that processes the data collected by the scraper service to generate actionable insights and reports:

- Geographic analysis and business density calculations
- Category performance analytics and benchmarking
- Business comparison against competitors and industry averages
- Automated report generation with visualization configurations
- Scheduled analysis processing for daily, weekly, and monthly insights

# Implementation Strategy
We've established a structured approach with the following components:

1. **Data Aggregators**: Three specialized modules for geographic, category, and business comparison analysis
2. **Report Generation**: Pipeline for transforming analysis data into standardized reports with chart configurations
3. **Job Processing**: Queue-based system for asynchronous report generation with progress tracking
4. **API Endpoints**: RESTful interface for accessing reports and requesting new analysis
5. **Database Schema**: Specialized tables for storing analysis results and report configurations

## Key Implementation Files:
- `aggregators/geographicInsights.ts` - Location-based analysis
- `aggregators/categoryAnalysis.ts` - Industry category performance analysis
- `aggregators/businessComparison.ts` - Competitive benchmarking
- `reports/reportGenerator.ts` - Report building and formatting
- `processors/reportProcessor.ts` - Queue processing for report generation

# What to skip
- Overly complex analysis algorithms
- Manual data processing tasks
- UI-specific visualization implementations

Cursor should:
- Focus on the data analysis service implementation
- Ensure efficient and reliable data processing
- Maintain a clear separation of concerns between modules

## Current Focus
