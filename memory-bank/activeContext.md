# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
- Implemented the complete scraper service with business discovery and website auditing capabilities
- Service is containerized and ready for deployment

## Recent Changes
- Created the scraper service with the following components:
  - Grid-based business discovery using Google Places API
  - Website auditing with Lighthouse
  - Screenshot capture for desktop and mobile views
  - Queue-based job processing with Redis
  - REST API for job management
- Implemented TypeScript-based service architecture
- Set up Docker configuration for both the scraper and Redis services
- Configured logging and error handling
- Added comprehensive API documentation

## Current Architecture
- Microservices:
  - Scraper Service (Node.js/TypeScript)
    - Business discovery module
    - Website audit module
    - Queue processing system
  - Redis for job queues
- Infrastructure:
  - Docker containers
  - Supabase for data storage
  - Google Places API for business discovery
  - Lighthouse for website auditing

## Next Steps
1. Test the scraper service:
   - Unit tests for processors
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Load testing for queue processing
2. Set up monitoring and alerting
3. Deploy to staging environment
4. Integrate with the main application

## Dependencies
- Node.js 18
- Redis 6
- Google Chrome (for Lighthouse)
- Google Maps API
- Supabase
- Docker

## Environment Configuration
Required environment variables:
- PORT
- NODE_ENV
- REDIS_URL
- GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
- SUPABASE_URL
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
- LOG_LEVEL

## Active Decisions
1. Scraper Architecture
   - Distributed vs. monolithic processing
   - Job queue implementation
   - Error handling strategy
   - Data storage approach

2. API Integration
   - Rate limiting strategy
   - Data source prioritization
   - Error recovery approach
   - Caching implementation

3. Infrastructure
   - Deployment architecture
   - Scaling approach
   - Monitoring solution
   - Backup strategy

## Current Challenges
1. Technical
   - API rate limit management
   - Distributed job processing
   - Data deduplication
   - Error recovery

2. Infrastructure
   - Service scaling
   - Resource allocation
   - Monitoring setup
   - Deployment pipeline

3. Data Quality
   - Source reliability
   - Data normalization
   - Validation rules
   - Update frequency

## Recent Feedback
- Need for automated business discovery
- Importance of reliable website auditing
- Request for better geographic coverage
- Focus on data quality and freshness

## Questions to Resolve
1. Technical
   - Best approach for geographic grid system?
   - Optimal job queue configuration?
   - Error handling strategy?
   - Data storage optimization?

2. Business
   - Priority of data sources?
   - Audit frequency requirements?
   - Coverage area definition?
   - Success metrics?

3. Infrastructure
   - Resource requirements?
   - Scaling thresholds?
   - Monitoring needs?
   - Backup strategy?
