## Development Environment Strategy
- **Lovable.dev** - Used for frontend development:
  - UI component development and styling
  - Frontend integration with backend APIs
  - User experience testing and refinement
  - Frontend build and deployment processes
  - Frontend routing and state management

- **Cursor** - Used for backend development:
  - Scraper service development and deployment
  - Database schema and migration management
  - Environment configuration and Docker setup
  - API service development and testing
  - Redis configuration and job queue management

## Technical Debt
- Add comprehensive test coverage
- Implement proper rate limiting
- Add retry mechanisms for failed jobs
- Set up proper monitoring
- Add metrics collection
- Fix ESM compatibility issues
- Standardize module system
- Improve build process
- Enhance deployment configuration

## Known Issues
- Need to handle API rate limits more gracefully
- Screenshot storage needs optimization
- Job queue monitoring needs improvement
- Analysis service requires tuning for larger datasets
- Complex TypeScript types can cause build issues with diagnostic code
- Balance needed between robust error handling and build compatibility
- Frontend needs improved error handling for API failures
