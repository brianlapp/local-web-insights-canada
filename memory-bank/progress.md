  - Category performance analytics and benchmarking
  - Business comparison and competitive insights
  - Report generation system with visualization configurations
  - Scheduled job processing for automated reports
  - Database schema for analysis storage
  - Docker configuration and deployment setup

## In Progress
- API Endpoints & Integration Layer
- Frontend Dashboard Development
- Enhanced Business Data Enrichment
- Scraper service deployment to Railway

## Upcoming
- Configure Redis service in Railway
- Set up production environment variables
- Test end-to-end scraper functionality
- Performance optimization
- User interface improvements
- Documentation updates

## Development Environment Strategy
- **Lovable.dev** - Used for frontend development:
  - UI component development and styling
  - Frontend integration with backend APIs
  - User experience testing and refinement
  - Frontend build and deployment processes
  - Frontend routing and state management

- **Cursor** - Used for backend development:
  - Scraper service development and deployment
  - Database schema and migration management
  - Environment configuration and Docker setup
  - API service development and testing
  - Redis configuration and job queue management

## Technical Debt
- Add comprehensive test coverage
- Implement proper rate limiting
- Add retry mechanisms for failed jobs
- Set up proper monitoring
- Add metrics collection

## Known Issues
- Need to handle API rate limits more gracefully
- Screenshot storage needs optimization
- Job queue monitoring needs improvement
- Analysis service requires tuning for larger datasets

## Milestones
✅ Project initialization
✅ Core functionality
✅ Authentication system
✅ Business management
✅ Scraper service architecture
✅ Business discovery implementation
✅ Website audit implementation
✅ Data Analysis & Insights Layer
⏳ API Endpoints & Integration
⏳ Frontend Dashboard
⏳ Business Data Enrichment
⏳ Production deployment
⏳ Performance optimization

## Notes
- The scraper service is now fully implemented with all core functionality
- Docker configuration is complete and tested locally
- The Data Analysis service is implemented with comprehensive analysis capabilities
- Report generation system is ready for integration with frontend
- Railway deployment configuration (railway.toml) has been created for the scraper service
- Need to add Redis service in Railway and configure environment variables
- Need to obtain the deployed service URL and update the vite.config.ts proxy settings
- Need to focus on API integration and frontend dashboard next
- Consider implementing caching for analysis results
- May need to optimize geographic calculations for larger datasets
- We've established a clear division of work between Lovable.dev (frontend) and Cursor (backend)
