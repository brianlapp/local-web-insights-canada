## Current Focus
We are currently in Phase 2, implementing the Admin Panel Integration. The next immediate tasks are:

1. ✅ Implement business analytics endpoints
2. ✅ Implement business search and filtering
3. Test business and analytics endpoints
4. Begin work on user management endpoints

Our progress is excellent, with business analytics and search capabilities now fully implemented. We should next focus on setting up the testing infrastructure or beginning work on user management endpoints.
