- Implemented proper build process for TypeScript code
- Added clean-up steps to reduce image size
- Configured for running in production mode

### Lighthouse Module Integration Fix (Complete)
- Created a compatibility wrapper to handle ESM/CommonJS module differences
- Implemented dynamic import with fallback to CommonJS require
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Successfully tested Lighthouse audit functionality

### Docker Environment Configuration (Complete)
- Fixed environment variable configuration by creating proper .env files
