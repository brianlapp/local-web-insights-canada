# Project Progress: Local Web Insights Canada

## Current Focus: Business Scraper Engine Implementation

## What Works
- ✅ Core directory structure for the project
- ✅ Environment setup with correct dependencies
- ✅ Supabase integration configured with real credentials
- ✅ API service foundation with Express/Node.js
- ✅ Business data schema and base endpoints
- ✅ Search and filtering functionality for businesses
- ✅ Authentication middleware with JWT support
- ✅ Error handling middleware
- ✅ TypeScript type checking with all linter errors resolved
- ✅ Validation middleware using express-validator

## What's Left to Build

### Priority: Business Scraper Engine
- 🔄 Google Places API integration:
  - Grid-based geographic search system
  - API client with rate limiting
  - Queue processing system
- 🔄 Website audit implementation:
  - URL validation and testing
  - Lighthouse performance testing
  - Tech detection system
  - Screenshot capture functionality
- 🔄 Data processing pipeline:
  - ETL processes for raw data
  - Error recovery mechanisms
  - Progress tracking system

### API Service Enhancements
- 🔄 Business analytics endpoints
- 🔄 Webhook integration
- 🔄 Testing infrastructure

### Analysis Service
- ⏳ Data aggregation system
- ⏳ Report generation
- ⏳ Scheduled processing

### Admin Panel
- ⏳ Admin authentication system
- ⏳ Business management interface
- ⏳ Analytics dashboard
- ⏳ User management system
- ⏳ Scraper control interface

## Current Status
- All TypeScript errors and linter issues are resolved
- Codebase is type-safe and ready for further development
- Supabase is connected with real credentials
- API service is functioning with core endpoints
- Business search and filtering is implemented with advanced query capabilities
- Ready to proceed with business scraper engine implementation

## Known Issues
- ✅ Fixed: All TypeScript linter errors have been resolved
- ✅ Fixed: ApiError constructor parameter order issues corrected
- ✅ Fixed: Missing type declarations for dependencies
- ✅ Fixed: Incorrect typing in authMiddleware.ts
- ⚠️ Need to implement tests for new endpoints
- ⚠️ Need to add proper logging throughout the application
- ⚠️ Rate limiting not yet implemented for external API calls
