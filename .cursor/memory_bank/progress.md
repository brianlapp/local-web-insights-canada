- ⚠️ Need to implement tests for new endpoints
- ⚠️ Need to add proper logging throughout the application
- ⚠️ Rate limiting configuration needs to be specified in environment variables
- ⚠️ Production build needs to be tested for performance and stability
- ⚠️ Need to implement monitoring and metrics collection
- ⚠️ Error recovery mechanisms for failed jobs need to be implemented

## Next Steps

   - Add error handling and recovery mechanisms
   - Implement job status monitoring
   - Add metrics collection

3. **Complete End-to-End Testing**
   - Test the full scraper pipeline
   - Verify that data is properly stored in Supabase
   - Monitor for any performance issues
   - Validate audit results

4. **Enhance API Service**
   - Add business analytics endpoints
   - Implement webhook integration
   - Set up testing framework
   - Add comprehensive logging
