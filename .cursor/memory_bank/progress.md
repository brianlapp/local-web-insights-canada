# Project Progress

## What Works

- Core directory structure for API service in `services/api`
- Environment setup with `.env` file and configuration
- Basic middleware for authentication, error handling, and validation
- Basic controller structure for business and webhook endpoints
- Supabase integration setup

## What's Left to Build

1. Fix remaining linter errors (in progress)
   - ✅ Fixed validation middleware
   - ✅ Fixed directory structure issues with scripts
   - ✅ Fixed ApiError constructor in authMiddleware
   - ✅ Fixed express-validator imports
   - ✅ Fixed Request interface for proper typing
   - ❌ Still need to fix ApiError constructor calls in controllers

2. Business Routes and Business Insights
   - Basic business routes implemented
   - Still need analytics endpoints
   - Need to implement search and filtering
   
3. Webhook Integration
   - Basic webhook controller implemented
   - Need to test webhook handling
   - Need to implement webhook delivery system

4. Testing Infrastructure
   - Need unit tests for all controllers
   - Need integration tests for API endpoints
   - Need database tests for Supabase integration

## Current Status

Currently focused on fixing linter errors and type issues before moving on to implementing the remaining functionality. The main issue is with the ApiError constructor calls in the controllers which need to be updated to match the new constructor signature.

## Known Issues

1. ApiError constructor parameter order issue in controllers
2. Some missing type definitions for dependencies
3. Need to update tests for the new middleware implementations
4. Need to implement proper logging for all endpoints

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining ApiError constructor calls
2. Implement business analytics endpoints
3. Add search and filtering to business endpoints
4. Set up testing infrastructure
5. Deploy API service
