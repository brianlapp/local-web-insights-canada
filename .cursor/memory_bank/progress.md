  - ‚úÖ Queue processing system
- ‚úÖ Website audit implementation:
  - ‚úÖ URL validation and testing
  - ‚úÖ Lighthouse performance testing
  - ‚úÖ Tech detection system
  - ‚úÖ Screenshot capture functionality
  - ‚úÖ Comprehensive scoring algorithm
- üîÑ Data processing pipeline:
  - ETL processes for raw data
  - Error recovery mechanisms
  - Progress tracking system

### API Service Enhancements
- üîÑ Business analytics endpoints
- üîÑ Webhook integration
- üîÑ Testing infrastructure

### Analysis Service

- ‚è≥ Business management interface
- ‚è≥ Analytics dashboard
- ‚è≥ User management system
- ‚è≥ Scraper control interface

## Current Status
- All TypeScript errors and linter issues are resolved
- Codebase is type-safe and ready for further development
- Supabase is connected with real credentials
- API service is functioning with core endpoints
- Business search and filtering is implemented with advanced query capabilities
- Google Places API integration is complete with API key rotation and advanced grid calculation
- Website Audit System is complete with URL validation, technology detection, Lighthouse integration, and comprehensive scoring
- Ready to proceed with data processing pipeline implementation

## Known Issues
- ‚úÖ Fixed: All TypeScript linter errors have been resolved
- ‚úÖ Fixed: ApiError constructor parameter order issues corrected
- ‚úÖ Fixed: Missing type declarations for dependencies
- ‚úÖ Fixed: Incorrect typing in authMiddleware.ts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to implement tests for new endpoints
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to add proper logging throughout the application
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Rate limiting configuration needs to be specified in environment variables
