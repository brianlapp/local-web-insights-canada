# Active Context - Local Web Insights Canada

## Current Focus
- Successfully resolved Redis connection issues in Railway deployment
- Implemented robust Redis client configuration with proper error handling
- Next: Addressing frontend connection issues

## Recent Changes

### Redis Connection Resolution
- Identified and fixed DNS resolution issues with `redis.railway.internal`
- Implemented solution using Railway's external proxy URL
- Added comprehensive logging for connection debugging
- Successfully deployed both Redis and scraper services

### Technical Learnings
1. Node.js DNS Resolution in Railway:
   - Internal DNS (`redis.railway.internal`) resolves in container shell but fails in Node.js
   - Solution: Use external proxy URLs (`*.proxy.rlwy.net`)
   - Configure TLS for Railway proxy connections

2. Redis Client Configuration:
   - Let Node.js choose IP version (`family: 0`)
   - Enable TLS for Railway proxy URLs
   - Implement proper error handling and retry logic
   - Add detailed logging for troubleshooting

3. Railway Service Communication:
   - External proxy URLs more reliable than internal DNS
   - Health checks working properly
   - Services properly linked and communicating

## Active Decisions
1. Use Railway's external proxy URLs for service communication
2. Enable TLS for all Railway proxy connections
3. Implement comprehensive logging for connection debugging

## Next Steps
1. Address frontend connection issues
2. Continue monitoring Redis connection stability
3. Implement any necessary frontend optimizations

## Current Considerations
- Monitor Redis connection performance with external proxy
- Watch for any TLS-related performance impacts
- Consider implementing connection pooling if needed
- Plan frontend connection troubleshooting strategy

## Development Environment Strategy

We've established a clear division of responsibilities between development environments:

1. **Lovable.dev** - Used for frontend development:
   - UI component development and styling
   - Frontend integration with backend APIs
   - User experience testing and refinement
   - Frontend build and deployment processes
   - Frontend routing and state management

2. **Cursor** - Used for backend development:
   - Scraper service development and deployment
   - Database schema and migration management
   - Environment configuration and Docker setup
   - API service development and testing
   - Redis configuration and job queue management

This approach allows us to leverage the strengths of each environment while maintaining a cohesive development workflow.

## Recent Changes

1. **Railway Deployment Configuration**
   - Created railway.toml configuration file for the scraper service
   - Set up build and deploy commands
   - Configured environment variables
   - Added health check endpoint
   - Prepared for production deployment

2. **Scraper Service Health Check**
   - Implemented `/api/health` endpoint
   - Added proper health check configuration
   - Set appropriate timeout values

3. **Production Build Preparation**
   - Configured production environment variables
   - Set up service discovery mechanism
   - Prepared for Redis integration in production

## Active Decisions

### Railway Deployment Strategy
- **Configuration Approach**:
  - Using Config as Code (railway.toml) for reproducible deployments
  - Environment variables defined in configuration file
  - Health check properly configured
- **Service Dependencies**:
  - Need to add Redis service in Railway
  - Need to configure environment variables in Railway dashboard
  - Need to link services together
- **Decision**: Will deploy scraper service first, then add Redis, and finally update frontend configuration

### Frontend Integration Strategy
- **Current Integration**:
  - Frontend currently configured to use local development endpoints
  - Need to update to use deployed services
  - Proxy configuration needs to be updated in vite.config.ts
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Need to handle CORS properly
  - Authentication tokens need to be forwarded
  - Need to ensure proper error handling
- **Decision**: Will update vite.config.ts with deployed service URL after deployment

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Deploy Scraper Service to Railway** (Cursor)
   - Push code with railway.toml to repository
   - Deploy using Railway dashboard or CLI
   - Verify health check is working

2. **Add Redis Service in Railway** (Cursor)
   - Create Redis service in Railway dashboard
   - Link Redis to scraper service
   - Verify REDIS_URL is correctly injected

3. **Update Frontend Configuration** (Lovable.dev)
   - Get deployed service URL
   - Update vite.config.ts proxy configuration
   - Test end-to-end functionality
   
4. **Implement Data Processing Pipeline** (Cursor)
   - Create ETL processes for raw data
   - Implement error handling and recovery
   - Build monitoring system for job status
   - Add metrics collection for performance monitoring

## Open Questions

1. How should we handle rate limiting in the production environment?
2. What monitoring metrics should we implement for the deployed service?
3. How should we handle automatic scaling for the scraper service?
4. What backup strategy should we implement for the Redis queue?
