## Current Focus: Production Build Testing & Data Pipeline Implementation

We've successfully implemented Supabase storage for screenshots and fixed the Lighthouse integration issues. Our immediate focus is now on testing the production build to ensure it works correctly before full deployment, and implementing the data processing pipeline.

## Recent Changes

1. **Supabase Storage Implementation**
   - Created storage buckets for screenshots
   - Implemented file upload functionality
   - Added support for both Supabase and GCS storage
   - Updated Docker environment configuration
   - Modified the website audit processor to handle the new storage system

2. **Production Dockerfile Creation**
   - Created a production-ready Dockerfile for the scraper service
   - Implemented proper TypeScript build process
   - Added clean-up steps to reduce image size
   - Configured for running in production mode

3. **Lighthouse Integration Fix**
   - Created a compatibility wrapper to handle ESM/CommonJS module differences
   - Implemented dynamic import with fallback to CommonJS require
   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging
   - Successfully tested Lighthouse audit functionality

4. **Docker Configuration**
   - Fixed ARM architecture compatibility by using the pre-built Puppeteer Docker image
   - Added proper user permissions with `--chown=pptruser:pptruser`
   - Configured the scraper to run in development mode
   - Successfully tested job queuing and processing

## Active Decisions

### Production Build Testing
- **Development vs Production**:
  - Development mode is currently working with ts-node-dev
  - Production build needs to compile TypeScript to JavaScript
  - Need to verify proper module imports in the built code
- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Production mode should have better performance
  - Need to ensure proper error handling
  - Memory usage should be monitored
- **Decision**: Will build and test the production image to verify both functionality and performance

### Data Processing Pipeline
- **Current Process**:
  - Raw business data is collected but needs further processing
  - ETL processes need to be implemented for data normalization
  - Error handling and recovery mechanisms need to be created
  - Monitoring system for job status is required
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Need to implement retry mechanisms for failed jobs
  - Need to add metrics collection for performance monitoring
  - Data integrity checks are required
- **Decision**: Will implement the data processing pipeline with robust error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Test Production Build**
   - Build using the new Dockerfile.production
   - Verify TypeScript compilation works correctly
   - Test running the built image
   - Monitor performance and resource usage

2. **Implement Data Processing Pipeline**
   - Create ETL processes for raw data
   - Implement error handling and recovery
   - Build monitoring system for job status
   - Add metrics collection for performance monitoring

3. **Complete End-to-End Testing**
   - Test full scraper functionality in production mode
   - Validate audit results
   - Verify data and screenshot storage in Supabase
   - Monitor for any performance issues

## Open Questions

1. What metrics should we collect to monitor the scraper's performance in production?
2. How should we handle error recovery for failed jobs in production?
3. What's the most efficient way to process large batches of raw business data?
4. Should we implement auto-scaling for the scraper service based on queue length?
