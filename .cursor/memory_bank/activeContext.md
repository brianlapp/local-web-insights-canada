# Active Context: Ottawa Business Data Import

## Current Focus
The current development focus has shifted to importing approximately 8,000 Ottawa businesses from a spreadsheet into the Local Web Insights Canada platform. This is a strategic pivot to address challenges with the real-time scraper's connectivity to the frontend dashboard. By importing this pre-collected dataset, we can:

1. Populate the dashboard with real Ottawa business data
2. Make the application immediately usable for demonstration and testing
3. Create a foundation for future scraping and auditing operations

## Recent Decisions

1. **Data Import Strategy**: Rather than relying solely on the real-time scraper, we will implement a bulk import process for existing business data from a spreadsheet containing ~8,000 Ottawa businesses.

2. **Initial Performance Grading**: We will develop a simplified scoring system to assign initial performance grades (A-F) to imported businesses based on available data, before running comprehensive Lighthouse audits.

3. **Implementation Phases**: The import process will follow a structured approach including data preparation, script development, database import, scoring, analysis, and dashboard integration.

## Next Steps

1. Review the spreadsheet format and create data mapping specifications
2. Develop import utilities to process the spreadsheet data
3. Implement the initial performance grading system
4. Execute the import process in batches
5. Generate initial insights and verify dashboard functionality

## Technical Considerations

1. **Data Integrity**: Ensure clean, normalized data during the import process
2. **Performance**: Optimize for bulk import operations (batch processing)
3. **Scoring Algorithm**: Create a realistic initial scoring system that can be refined as more data becomes available
4. **User Experience**: Ensure imported data is immediately useful in the dashboard interface

This approach will provide a practical solution to the current connectivity challenges while maintaining progress toward the project's objectives.
