## Current Focus: Supabase Storage and Production Build Testing

We've successfully fixed the Lighthouse integration issues with a compatibility wrapper and created a production-ready Dockerfile for the scraper service. Our immediate focus is now on setting up Supabase storage for screenshot storage and testing the production build to ensure it works correctly before full deployment.

## Recent Changes

1. **Production Dockerfile Creation**
   - Created a production-ready Dockerfile for the scraper service
   - Implemented proper TypeScript build process
   - Added clean-up steps to reduce image size
   - Configured for running in production mode

2. **Lighthouse Integration Fix**
   - Created a compatibility wrapper to handle ESM/CommonJS module differences
   - Implemented dynamic import with fallback to CommonJS require
   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging
   - Successfully tested Lighthouse audit functionality

3. **Docker Configuration**
   - Fixed ARM architecture compatibility by using the pre-built Puppeteer Docker image
   - Added proper user permissions with `--chown=pptruser:pptruser`
   - Configured the scraper to run in development mode
   - Successfully tested job queuing and processing

4. **Testing Environment**
   - Staging environment is available at https://local-web-insights-canada.lovable.app/
   - Core API functionality is already deployed to staging

## Active Decisions

### Supabase Storage Configuration
- **Issue**: Screenshot storage requires properly configured Supabase buckets
- **Options**:
  1. Create public buckets with specific access patterns
  2. Use private buckets with signed URLs
  3. Use temporary storage during testing
- **Technical Consideration**: Proper storage configuration is needed for full end-to-end testing
- **Decision**: Will create a public bucket with structured folders for easy access during testing

### Production Build Testing
- **Development vs Production**:
  - Development mode is currently working with ts-node-dev
  - Production build needs to compile TypeScript to JavaScript
  - Need to verify proper module imports in the built code
- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Production mode should have better performance
  - Need to ensure proper error handling
  - Memory usage should be monitored
- **Decision**: Will build and test the production image to verify both functionality and performance

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Set Up Supabase Storage**
   - Create 'public' storage bucket for screenshots
   - Organize with folders by businessId
   - Configure proper permissions
   - Test screenshot upload functionality

2. **Test Production Build**
   - Build using the new Dockerfile.production
   - Verify TypeScript compilation works correctly
   - Test running the built image
   - Monitor performance and resource usage

3. **Complete End-to-End Testing**
   - Test full scraper functionality in production mode
   - Validate audit results
   - Verify data and screenshot storage in Supabase
   - Monitor for any performance issues

## Open Questions

1. What is the best storage structure for screenshots in Supabase?
2. How should we handle error recovery for failed jobs in production?
3. What metrics should we collect to monitor the scraper's performance in production?
4. Should we implement auto-scaling for the scraper service based on queue length?
