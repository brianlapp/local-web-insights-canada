# Memory Bank Consolidation Plan

## Background
The Local Web Insights Canada project was using two separate memory bank locations:
- `.cursor/memory-bank/` (with hyphen)
- `.cursor/memory_bank/` (with underscore)

This inconsistency created confusion and made it difficult to track project progress effectively. This document describes the consolidation plan that was executed to resolve this issue.

## Consolidation Process

### Phase 1: Discovery & Analysis
- ✅ Identified all files in both memory bank locations
- ✅ Created an inventory of content in each location
- ✅ Determined content overlap and unique information
- ✅ Identified key files for consolidation:
  - Project brief
  - Product context
  - Technical context
  - System patterns
  - Implementation plan
  - Progress tracking

### Phase 2: Consolidation Strategy
- ✅ Created a new consolidated directory: `.cursor/memory_bank_consolidated/`
- ✅ Developed a file mapping strategy
- ✅ Established content merging approach
- ✅ Determined file format standardization

### Phase 3: Execution
- ✅ Created consolidated files with merged content:
  - `projectbrief.md`: Core project information and requirements
  - `productContext.md`: Product goals, user experience, and workflows
  - `techContext.md`: Technical stack, architecture, and dependencies
  - `systemPatterns.md`: Architecture diagrams and design patterns
  - `implementationPlan.md`: Development phases and timeline
- ✅ Ensured all critical information was preserved during consolidation
- ✅ Standardized formatting and organization across documents
- ✅ Added clear section headers and navigation structure
- ✅ Updated cross-references between documents

### Phase 4: Verification & Cleanup
- ✅ Confirmed all important information was migrated
- ✅ Applied consistent formatting across all documents
- ✅ Validated technical accuracy of merged content
- ✅ Ensured focus on business scraper engine as the priority
- ✅ Documented the consolidation process (this file)

## Consolidated Structure

```
.cursor/memory_bank_consolidated/
├── projectbrief.md          # Project overview and requirements
├── productContext.md        # Product goals and user experience
├── techContext.md           # Technical architecture and stack
├── systemPatterns.md        # System design patterns and flows
├── implementationPlan.md    # Development plan and timeline
└── consolidationPlan.md     # Documentation of this process
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All project documentation is now in one location with a consistent structure.

2. **Improved Organization**: Content is logically separated into well-structured documents with clear purposes.

3. **Enhanced Focus**: Documentation clearly emphasizes the business scraper engine as the priority component.

4. **Better Navigation**: Standardized formatting and cross-references make information easier to find.

5. **Reduced Redundancy**: Duplicate information has been merged, while preserving unique details from each source.

## Next Steps

1. **Transition to Consolidated Memory Bank**: Use the new consolidated location for all future project documentation.

2. **Archive Legacy Locations**: Consider archiving the original memory bank locations once the consolidated approach is validated.

3. **Continue Documentation Updates**: Keep documentation current as the project progresses, particularly focusing on the business scraper engine implementation.

4. **Improve as Needed**: Refine the consolidated documentation structure if additional needs are identified during development.
