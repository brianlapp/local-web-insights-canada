# Action Plan: April 2025

## Current Action Items

1. **Deploy Scraper Service to Railway**
   - **Description**: Push code with railway.toml and deploy the scraper service
   - **Tasks**:
     - [ ] Push updated code with railway.toml to repository
     - [ ] Deploy service using Railway dashboard or CLI
     - [ ] Verify health check endpoint is working
     - [ ] Monitor initial deployment for any issues
   - **Dependencies**: railway.toml configuration, deployment access
   - **Expected Timeline**: 1-2 days
   - **Success Criteria**: Service successfully deployed and health check passing

2. **Set Up Redis in Railway**
   - **Description**: Create Redis service and link it to the scraper service
   - **Tasks**:
     - [ ] Create Redis service from Railway dashboard
     - [ ] Link Redis to scraper service
     - [ ] Verify REDIS_URL is correctly injected
     - [ ] Test queue functionality in production
   - **Dependencies**: Deployed scraper service
   - **Expected Timeline**: 1 day
   - **Success Criteria**: Redis service running and linked to scraper

3. **Update Frontend Configuration**
   - **Description**: Update frontend to use deployed scraper service
   - **Tasks**:
     - [ ] Get deployed service URL from Railway
     - [ ] Update vite.config.ts proxy configuration
     - [ ] Test API connectivity from frontend
     - [ ] Verify authentication works correctly
   - **Dependencies**: Deployed scraper service URL
   - **Expected Timeline**: 1 day
   - **Success Criteria**: Frontend successfully communicates with deployed service

4. **Implement Data Processing Pipeline**
   - **Description**: Create ETL processes for raw business data with error handling and monitoring
   - **Tasks**:
     - [ ] Design data normalization workflow
     - [ ] Implement transformation functions
     - [ ] Create retry mechanisms for failed jobs
     - [ ] Add status tracking for processing jobs
     - [ ] Implement alerting for critical errors
     - [ ] Set up metrics collection
   - **Dependencies**: Working scraper service
   - **Expected Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
   - **Success Criteria**: Raw data is successfully processed with proper error handling

## Decision Points

1. **Storage Strategy**
   - **Question**: Should we continue supporting both Supabase and GCS storage?
   - **Options**:
     - Continue with dual storage support
     - Standardize on one storage provider
     - Implement more sophisticated fallback mechanism
   - **Decision Criteria**: Reliability, cost, ease of management
   - **Decision Deadline**: Before production deployment

2. **Scaling Approach**
   - **Question**: How should we scale the scraper service in production?
   - **Options**:
     - Horizontal scaling with multiple containers
     - Vertical scaling with larger instances
     - Auto-scaling based on queue length
   - **Decision Criteria**: Performance needs, cost considerations, reliability
   - **Decision Deadline**: Before production deployment

3. **Monitoring Strategy**
   - **Question**: What metrics should we collect for monitoring?
   - **Options**:
     - Basic system metrics (CPU, memory, network)
     - Application-specific metrics (job completion, error rates)
     - Comprehensive monitoring with alerting
   - **Decision Criteria**: Operational needs, debugging requirements
   - **Decision Deadline**: During data pipeline implementation

## Implementation Notes

### Railway Deployment
- Use `railway up` or the Railway dashboard to deploy the service
- Set required environment variables in Railway dashboard
- Monitor logs after deployment for any issues
- Test health check endpoint immediately after deployment

### Redis Setup
- Create Redis service from Railway dashboard
- Use the "Add Service" button and select Redis
- Link to scraper service using the Railway dashboard
- Test connection using a simple job

### Frontend Integration
- Update vite.config.ts with the deployed service URL
- Keep local development proxy fallback for development
- Test both development and production configurations
- Add proper error handling for connectivity issues

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Deployment Issues**
   - **Risk**: Configuration or environment issues during deployment
   - **Impact**: High - Could prevent service from starting
   - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing of railway.toml locally, prepare rollback plan

2. **Redis Connectivity**
   - **Risk**: Issues connecting to Redis from the scraper service
   - **Impact**: High - Would prevent job processing
   - **Mitigation**: Test connectivity immediately after setup, prepare fallback options

3. **Environment Variable Management**
   - **Risk**: Missing or incorrect environment variables
   - **Impact**: High - Could cause service failures
   - **Mitigation**: Document all required variables, create verification script

4. **Performance in Production**
   - **Risk**: Service performance issues at scale
   - **Impact**: Medium - Could slow job processing
   - **Mitigation**: Start with conservative workloads, gradually increase

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Push updated code with railway.toml to repository
2. Deploy scraper service to Railway
3. Verify health check endpoint is working
4. Create and link Redis service in Railway
5. Get deployed service URL and update frontend configuration
