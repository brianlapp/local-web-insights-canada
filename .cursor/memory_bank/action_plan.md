# Action Plan: April 2025

## Current Action Items

1. **Test Production Build**
   - **Description**: Build and test the production Docker image to verify functionality and performance
   - **Tasks**:
     - [ ] Build Docker image using Dockerfile.production
     - [ ] Run the image with test configuration
     - [ ] Verify Lighthouse integration works
     - [ ] Confirm screenshot storage is working
     - [ ] Measure memory and CPU usage
     - [ ] Compare performance with development mode
   - **Dependencies**: Dockerfile.production, Docker environment
   - **Expected Timeline**: 2-3 days
   - **Success Criteria**: Production image runs successfully with all functionality working

2. **Implement Data Processing Pipeline**
   - **Description**: Create ETL processes for raw business data with error handling and monitoring
   - **Tasks**:
     - [ ] Design data normalization workflow
     - [ ] Implement transformation functions
     - [ ] Create retry mechanisms for failed jobs
     - [ ] Add status tracking for processing jobs
     - [ ] Implement alerting for critical errors
     - [ ] Set up metrics collection
   - **Dependencies**: Working scraper service
   - **Expected Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
   - **Success Criteria**: Raw data is successfully processed with proper error handling

3. **Enhance API Service**
   - **Description**: Add business analytics endpoints and improve testing infrastructure
   - **Tasks**:
     - [ ] Design analytics API endpoints
     - [ ] Implement data aggregation functions
     - [ ] Create webhook integration for notifications
     - [ ] Set up testing framework
     - [ ] Add comprehensive logging
   - **Dependencies**: Core API service
   - **Expected Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
   - **Success Criteria**: Analytics endpoints work correctly with proper testing

## Decision Points

1. **Storage Strategy**
   - **Question**: Should we continue supporting both Supabase and GCS storage?
   - **Options**:
     - Continue with dual storage support
     - Standardize on one storage provider
     - Implement more sophisticated fallback mechanism
   - **Decision Criteria**: Reliability, cost, ease of management
   - **Decision Deadline**: Before production deployment

2. **Scaling Approach**
   - **Question**: How should we scale the scraper service in production?
   - **Options**:
     - Horizontal scaling with multiple containers
     - Vertical scaling with larger instances
     - Auto-scaling based on queue length
   - **Decision Criteria**: Performance needs, cost considerations, reliability
   - **Decision Deadline**: Before production deployment

3. **Monitoring Strategy**
   - **Question**: What metrics should we collect for monitoring?
   - **Options**:
     - Basic system metrics (CPU, memory, network)
     - Application-specific metrics (job completion, error rates)
     - Comprehensive monitoring with alerting
   - **Decision Criteria**: Operational needs, debugging requirements
   - **Decision Deadline**: During data pipeline implementation

## Implementation Notes

### Production Build Testing
- Use `docker build -f Dockerfile.production -t local-web-insights:prod .` to build the image
- Test with a small sample of businesses first
- Compare memory usage and processing time with development mode
- Document any issues encountered during testing

### Data Processing Pipeline
- Start with simple ETL processes and gradually add complexity
- Implement retry with exponential backoff for failed jobs
- Create clear error categories to aid in debugging
- Consider implementing a circuit breaker pattern for external API calls

### API Service Enhancements
- Design RESTful endpoints for analytics data
- Use query parameters for filtering and aggregation options
- Implement pagination for large result sets
- Add comprehensive request/response logging

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Production Build Issues**
   - **Risk**: Module compatibility problems when building TypeScript code
   - **Impact**: High - Could prevent production deployment
   - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing, prepare fallback options

2. **Data Processing Errors**
   - **Risk**: Failure to process certain business data formats
   - **Impact**: Medium - Could result in incomplete data
   - **Mitigation**: Add robust validation, implement recovery mechanisms

3. **Performance Bottlenecks**
   - **Risk**: Slow processing in production environment
   - **Impact**: Medium - Could affect data freshness
   - **Mitigation**: Performance monitoring, optimization of critical paths

4. **API Rate Limiting**
   - **Risk**: Exceeding API quotas in production
   - **Impact**: High - Could disrupt data collection
   - **Mitigation**: Implement rate limiting, add quota monitoring

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Build and test the production Docker image
2. Document performance metrics and any issues
3. Begin designing the data processing pipeline
4. Create initial draft of API enhancement plan
