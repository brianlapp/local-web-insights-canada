# Railway Deployment Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Conflicting railway.toml Configuration**
   - Found duplicate railway.toml files (root and /services/scraper)
   - Fixed by keeping both but ensuring they work together properly
   - Root toml now explicitly directs Railway to the scraper service

2. **Environment Variable Inconsistency**
   - Code was looking for `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` but we had `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEYS`
   - Added code to support both variable names
   - Added environment variable mapping in railway.toml 

3. **API Routing Issues**
   - Fixed potentially conflicting route paths
   - Changed `/api/health` to `/health-detailed` to avoid confusion

4. **Redis Connection**
   - Made sure the Railway Redis connection details are properly configured
   - Removed hardcoded Redis URL from railway.toml to use Railway service linking

## How to Deploy

1. Commit and push these changes to your repository
2. In Railway dashboard, try redeploying the service
3. If it still fails, you may need to manually create a new deployment
4. Check the logs to ensure the service starts up correctly

## Testing After Deployment

1. Check the `/health` endpoint to verify the service is running
2. Test the `/super-debug` endpoint to verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Try simple API endpoints before testing the full scraper functionality

## Troubleshooting

If deployment still fails:
1. Check Railway logs for specific error messages
2. Verify that Railway has all required environment variables
3. Try deploying just the scraper service directory directly to isolate issues
