# API Route Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect API URL in Frontend**: 
   - The frontend was trying to access `https://local-web-scraper-production.up.railway.app/api`
   - The correct URL is `https://local-web-insights-canada-production.up.railway.app/api`

2. **Router Initialization Issues**:
   - The Express router might not have been properly initialized
   - Added additional logging to diagnose route registration issues

3. **Missing Direct Route Testing**:
   - Added direct route handlers to help diagnose API issues
   - Added comprehensive debugging endpoints

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend URL Fix
- Updated API base URL in `scraperService.ts`
- Added console logging of the API URL for debugging

### 2. Improved Backend Debugging
- Added more detailed route logging
- Added standalone test endpoints at various paths
- Added direct route handlers for comparison

### 3. Enhanced 404 Handler
- Improved 404 response with more diagnostic info
- Added request details to error logs
- Listed all available routes in the 404 response

### 4. Additional Test Endpoints
- Added `/start` direct endpoint
- Added `/direct-start` alternative endpoint
- Added `/api-test` simple test endpoint

### 5. Better Error Logging
- Enhanced 404 logging with request details
- Added request body logging for debugging
- Added environment variable status logging

## How to Test the Changes

1. Deploy the updated code to Railway
2. Test the basic health endpoints:
   - `/health`
   - `/super-debug`
3. Test direct endpoints:
   - POST to `/start`
   - POST to `/direct-start`
4. Test API endpoints:
   - POST to `/api/start`
   - POST to `/api/test-start`
5. Check logs for detailed diagnostics

## Next Steps

1. Verify frontend can connect to backend
2. Test the scraper functionality end-to-end
3. Add more monitoring for production
