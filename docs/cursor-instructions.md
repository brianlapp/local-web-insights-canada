# Instructions for Cursor: Admin Panel Implementation

Hi Cursor! I need your help implementing an admin panel for the LocalWebsiteAudit.ca project. This admin panel will allow me to manage business audits, track petition signatures, and handle the content that powers the public-facing site.

## What We Already Have
- We've already implemented test files for the public-facing components
- Supabase connection is set up
- Basic site structure is in place
- shadcn/ui components are installed and working

## What We Need Now
I need an admin panel implementation that focuses on functionality rather than extensive testing. This should include:

1. **Admin Authentication**
   - A simple login page that connects to Supabase Auth
   - Protected admin routes

2. **Business Management**
   - Forms to create/edit business audits
   - Upload functionality for screenshots
   - Fields for all audit data (scores, recommendations, etc.)

3. **Petition Management**
   - View and export petition signatures
   - Filter signatures by business

4. **Dashboard**
   - Simple statistics and overview

## Implementation Approach
- Create a roadmap for implementing these features
- Start with a decisions.md file to outline your approach
- Implement the features one by one, starting with authentication
- Focus on making a functional admin panel, not extensive testing
- Connect to the existing Supabase instance

## Next Steps
Let's start with:
1. Creating a roadmap for the admin panel implementation
2. Setting up the admin authentication
3. Implementing the business management forms

Please create a roadmap that outlines how we'll build this admin panel, then we'll start implementation.
