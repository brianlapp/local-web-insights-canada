## Core Feature Testing

### Website Audit Feature

#### Happy Path: User views a business audit page

```gherkin
FEATURE: Business Audit Page
  AS A potential client
  I WANT to view a comprehensive audit of a local business website
  SO THAT I can understand the website's performance issues

  Scenario: User visits a valid business audit page
    Given the user navigates to "/{validBusinessSlug}"
    When the page loads
    Then the user should see a loading skeleton
    And the API should be called with the correct business slug
    And upon successful data fetch, the loading skeleton should be replaced with audit data
    And the audit data should contain sections for:
      | SEO analysis         |
      | Performance metrics  |
      | Mobile compatibility |
      | User experience      |
      | Technical issues     |
    And each section should show a score/rating
    And each section should contain specific actionable recommendations
    And the page should display the business name and logo
    And a call-to-action button should be visible
```

#### Error Path: Invalid or missing business

```gherkin
  Scenario: User visits a non-existent business audit page
    Given the user navigates to "/{invalidBusinessSlug}"
    When Supabase query returns no results
    Then the loading skeleton should be replaced with an error message
    And the error message should suggest searching for a different business
    And a search input field should be displayed
    And suggested businesses may be shown if available

  Scenario: Database failure while fetching audit data
    Given the user navigates to "/{validBusinessSlug}"
    When the Supabase client encounters an error
    Then an error toast notification should appear
    And a retry button should be displayed
    And error details should be logged (but not shown to user)
    And a fallback UI should be shown with contact information
```

### Petition Feature

#### Happy Path: User signs a petition

```gherkin
FEATURE: Business Support Petition
  AS A customer of a local business
  I WANT to sign a petition supporting their website improvement
  SO THAT I can help the business understand the importance of their online presence

  Scenario: User successfully signs a petition

      | Email (required)       |
      | Comment (optional)     |
      | Rating (optional)      |
    When the user fills all required fields with valid data
    And submits the form
    Then a success message should appear

    And a share button/link should be displayed
    And the user's submission should appear in the list of supporters
```

#### Error Path: Form validation issues

```gherkin
  Scenario: User submits the petition form with invalid data

    When the user submits the form with:
      | Name: "" (empty)             |
      | Email: "notavalidemail"      |
    Then validation errors should appear under each invalid field
    And the form should not be submitted
    And the focus should be set to the first invalid field
    
  Scenario: Database failure during petition submission
    Given the user has filled the petition form with valid data
    When the form is submitted
    And the Supabase insert operation fails
    Then an error toast notification should appear
    And the form should remain filled with user data
    And a retry button should be displayed
```

    Given the user's device loses internet connection
    When the user attempts to load new data
    Then an offline notification should appear
    And locally cached data should still be accessible
    And when connection is restored, a sync option should be offered
    
  Scenario: Slow network connections
    Given the user has a very slow network connection
    When data is being fetched

## Performance Testing

```gherkin
FEATURE: Page Load Performance
  AS A user of the application
  I WANT pages to load quickly
  SO THAT I can access information without delays

  Scenario: Initial page load time

    Then core content should be visible within 1.5 seconds
    And the First Contentful Paint (FCP) should be under 1 second
    And the Total Blocking Time (TBT) should be under 300ms
    
  Scenario: Subsequent navigation performance
    Given a user has already loaded the application
    When the user navigates to another route
    Then the page transition should appear instantaneous
    And unnecessary network requests should not be made
    And cached data should be utilized when appropriate
```
