# Data Analysis & Insights Layer Implementation

## Overview

We've successfully implemented the first phase of our implementation plan: the Data Analysis & Insights Layer for Local Web Insights Canada. This service analyzes the data collected by the scraper service to generate meaningful insights and reports for businesses and cities.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Data Models and Types

We've defined comprehensive TypeScript types for:
- Base data types matching the database schema
- Analysis-specific data structures
- Report generation interfaces
- Geographic and business comparison types

### 2. Data Aggregators

Three key aggregators have been implemented:

**Geographic Insights Aggregator**
- Calculates business density across geographic areas
- Generates performance heatmaps for visualizing web performance by location
- Provides regional insights including category distribution and average scores

**Category Analysis Aggregator**
- Analyzes performance metrics for businesses by category
- Identifies common improvement areas within specific industries
- Compares and ranks categories by overall performance
- Highlights top and struggling categories in a region

**Business Comparison Aggregator**
- Compares individual businesses against industry averages
- Calculates performance percentiles and rankings
- Identifies strengths and weaknesses relative to competitors
- Tracks historical performance to establish trends

### 3. Report Generation System

We've created a structured report generation system that:
- Transforms aggregated data into standardized report formats
- Includes chart configurations for frontend visualization
- Supports multiple report types (city, category, business, comparison)
- Enables filtering and parameterization of reports

### 4. Report Processing Queue

Implemented a job processing system using Bull that:
- Handles asynchronous report generation
- Tracks job progress and handles errors
- Supports scheduled report generation through cron jobs
- Enables daily, weekly, and monthly automatic reporting

### 5. API Endpoints

Created RESTful endpoints for:
- Retrieving saved reports with filtering options
- Requesting new report generation
- Checking the status of in-progress reports

### 6. Database Schema

Designed a complete database schema for the analysis service with:
- Report storage tables
- Geographic and category insights tables
- Business comparison data storage
- Performance trend tracking
- Report scheduling configuration

### 7. Deployment Configuration

Set up deployment tooling including:
- Docker configuration for containerization
- Environment variable management
- Database migration utilities
- Docker compose integration

## Key Features

1. **Geographic Analysis**
   - Business density calculations by region
   - Performance heatmaps for visual analysis
   - Category distribution by location

2. **Category Performance Analysis**
   - Industry benchmarking
   - Common improvement areas by category
   - Identification of top and struggling categories

3. **Competitive Insights**
   - Business ranking within category and city
   - Strength and weakness identification
   - Performance comparisons against industry averages

4. **Trend Analysis**
   - Historical performance tracking
   - Score improvement/degradation measurement
   - Time-based comparison of metrics

5. **Automated Reporting**
   - Daily city reports
   - Weekly category analysis
   - Monthly top performer comparisons

## Next Steps

Having completed the Data Analysis & Insights Layer, we're now ready to move to the next phase of our implementation plan:

1. **API Endpoints & Integration**
   - Build RESTful API structure with authentication
   - Implement query endpoints with filtering capabilities
   - Create report generation endpoints
   - Add webhook integration for external systems

This will provide the foundation for integrating our analysis capabilities with the frontend and external systems in subsequent phases.
