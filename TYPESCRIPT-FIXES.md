# TypeScript Build Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Request Type Problems**:
   - The Express Request type in TypeScript doesn't include some properties like `path`, `url`, and `originalUrl` in the default type definition
   - Fixed by simplifying the 404 handler to avoid using these properties

2. **Frontend URL Correction**:
   - Updated the API base URL in the frontend to point to the correct Railway deployment URL
   - Added debug logging of the API URL for troubleshooting

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed 404 Handler Type Issue
```typescript
// Original code with type errors
app.use((req: Request, res: Response) => {
  logger.warn(`Route not found: ${req.method} ${req.path}`, {
    headers: req.headers,
    query: req.query,
    body: req.method !== 'GET' ? req.body : undefined,
    url: req.url,
    originalUrl: req.originalUrl,
    path: req.path
  });
  
  // ...
});

// Fixed code without type errors
app.use((req: Request, res: Response) => {
  logger.warn(`Route not found: ${req.method}`, {
    query: req.query,
    body: req.method !== 'GET' ? req.body : undefined,
  });
  
  // ...
});
```

### 2. Frontend API URL Fix
```typescript
// Old incorrect URL
const SCRAPER_API_BASE_URL = 'https://local-web-scraper-production.up.railway.app/api';

// New correct URL
const SCRAPER_API_BASE_URL = 'https://local-web-insights-canada-production.up.railway.app/api';
```

## Testing

1. Verified that the TypeScript build completes successfully
2. Ensured that the frontend is pointing to the correct API URL
3. Added additional logging to help diagnose any further issues

## Notes

If you experience TypeScript errors in the future, remember to:

1. Look for type compatibility issues with third-party libraries
2. Add more specific type annotations when necessary
3. Sometimes simplifying code (removing references to potentially missing properties) is better than trying to add complex type definitions
